Three Major Project Ideas
===========================================

Idea 1
------
### Overview

A publication celebrating the contributions women have made to the design industry and what it means to be a female designer.
According to research conducted by The Design Council:

>“78% of the UK’s design workforce is male. This is higher than the percentage of men in the wider UK workforce (53%). This is also despite women making up 63% of all students studying creative arts and design courses at university”

Unfortunately, the report goes on to state that women are far less likely to be in senior design roles:

> “Women are also far less likely than men to be in senior roles, with only 17% of design managers or owners being female, and they earn less than men in their respective sectors, with female product and clothing designers earning 18% less than their male counterparts.”

I would like to create a digital publication focusing on the women in design who have paved the way for the rest of us! I feel that this will also help women beginning to enter the industry to find good female role-models and be inspired to achieve. 
As the famous Isaac Newton quote goes:
> “If I have seen further it is only by standing on the shoulders of giants”

It should not just be a book listing the achievements of these women, it should also have motivational aspects to it, maybe quotes or interesting illustrations.
I think of this project as a sort-of digital fan-zine that serves as inspiration for aspiring female designers.

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros
- A cause I feel strongly about 
- Would be a helpful guide for women starting out in the design industry or study, especially if they find it difficult to find female designers to relate to in their social circle.
- Get to show off my illustration skills in a way that I am excited about
- I would learn more about self-publishing and designing for digital publications

#### Cons
- Wide range of people to feature so I need to be specific about who I am featuring and why.
- Need to be clear that we need men to help in this fight- we are not manhating, we just want to promote women as they climb the career ladder in design.
- Have to be careful not to look like a weird design fangirl.

### How might it be built?

I would like to make this an ebook, making it available as a PDF, ePub and .mobi. Filled with beautiful illustrations, I hope this publication will be a beautiful work that will shine a light on the amazing women  who work in our industry. I would also like to explore the posibility of having merchandise to support the initial product.

### Who’s it for?

The main audience for this book is women who work or are hoping to work in the design industry. I also feel that there can be a secondary audience found in men who want to support their female counterparts and appreciate good design. The Design Council put it best: 
> “Men aren’t the enemy – far from it…. We urgently need men and women to be equal parts of the solution.”

### What’s the business model?

The ebook will be marketed and sold online, and potentially also available through self publishing channels like amazon etc.

Idea 2
------

### Overview

As adults, we still crave visual things, but we feel we have left the days of picture story-books behind. Pictures are for children who can’t read and when you’re an adult you read regular books. Comics can be heavy handed and childish in storytelling and often don’t bridge the gap between written content and visual work as well as some people would like. I would like to create a book that doesn’t compromise on mature content and storytelling but also brings in beautiful illustrations to fit that visual need.
Think folio society, but not just limited to cover content. 
I think the narrative of the book could highlight beautiful, authentic interactions that can still happen in an increasingly distant and polished world. 

### Pros and Cons

## Pros

- Physical books! Yay! (and I could also make an ebook version for wider distribution).
- Shows off illustration skills.
- I would learn more about self publishing and marketing books.

## Cons

- I’ve never written something that full length before but I am excited to learn (maybe I could collaborate with someone else if I am stuck).
- People might not want to read it.

### How might it be built?

As a physical copy of a book with attention to craftsmanship, but also available as an ePub etc.

### Who’s it for?

Adults of any gender who appreciate storytelling combined with beautiful illustration and typography. I would say the main target market is the 18-35 range but obviously anyone who wants to read can read it.

### What’s the business model?

It could be funded initially by Kickstarter, or backed by local funding (invest NI etc.)

Idea 3

### Overview

An anger relieving mobile game idea.

Frustration is everywhere. I only have to look at the news and I want to scream. But how can I relieve this anger in a healthy way?

The idea behind this mobile game is not dissimilar to that of whack a mole, just with more ability to customize it for your specific needs. Make a character to vent your frustration at while you whack them over the head with a mallet for points. Tap away to your heart’s content, knowing that you are releasing your anger in a healthy way.

### Pros and Cons

## Pros
- You could definitely have fun making a choice of different avatars to play the game with (like mii’s or the character selection in crossy road).
- A fun project the has many visual aspects to it.

## Cons
- Character customization screen sounds super difficult.
- Lots to do and learn in a short space of time.
- Never built a game before.

### How might it be built?

In Unity with exported models from C4D.

### Who’s it for?

Angry adults who own phones.

### What’s the business model?

In game advertisements and micro-purchases.
